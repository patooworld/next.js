title: unstable_after (Experimental)
description: API Reference for the unstable_after function.
---

> This API is **experimental** and subject to change.

`unstable_after()` allows you to schedule work to be executed after a response is finished. This is useful for tasks and other side effects that should not block the response, such as logging and analytics.

It can be used in [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) (including [`generateMetadata`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata)), [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations), [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers), and [Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware).

To use `unstable_after()`, you need to enable it using the `experimental.after` config in the `next.config.js` file:

```js filename="next.config.js"
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    after: true,
  },
}
module.exports = nextConfig
```

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx switcher
import { unstable_after as after } from 'next/server'
import { log } from '@/app/utils'

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  after(() => {
    // Execute after the layout is rendered and sent to the user
    log()
  })
  return <>{children}</>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js switcher
import { unstable_after as after } from 'next/server'
import { log } from '@/app/utils'

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  after(() => {
    // Execute after the layout is rendered and sent to the user
    log()
  })
  return <>{children}</>
}
```

> **Good to know**:
>
> - `unstable_after()` will be executed even if the response didn't complete successfully. Including when an error is thrown or when `notFound()` or `redirect()` is called.
> - `unstable_after()` is a [dynamic function](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-functions) that will opt a route into dynamic rendering. This behavior can be overridden with the [`export dynamic = "force-static"`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamic) segment config.
> - You can use React `cache` to deduplicate functions called inside `unstable_after()`.
> - [`cookies()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) cannot be set inside `unstable_after()` since the response has already been sent.

### Parameters

- A function that will be executed after the response is finished.

### Returns

- `unstable_after()` does not return a value.
